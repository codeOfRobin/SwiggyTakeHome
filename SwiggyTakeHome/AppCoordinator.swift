/// From Dave Delong's(@davedelong) excellent docs:
/// The AppCoordinator is the entry point of the entire app (other than the App Delegate).
/// It provides high-level control of the various components of the app, and does small amounts
/// of data shuffling between them.

/// This is called a coordinator to avoid too much overloading of the word "Controller".
